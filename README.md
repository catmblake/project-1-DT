# project-1-DT
This project is a mobile-responsive web application named The Hive. The concept of the app is to aggregate relevant local content for new residents of cities throughout the United States. A user creates an account and fills out their profile information. The webpage then displays recommendations based on the user's selected zipcode and interests. This application uses firebase authentication to create user accounts and store each user's associated profile information in a realtime database. A proxy server is used to make ajax calls to both Google Places and MeetUp APIs. Using JavaScript and jQuery the top 3 local results for each of the user's interests is dynamically displayed in their profile page. The user can update their information via a settings page if they wish.
